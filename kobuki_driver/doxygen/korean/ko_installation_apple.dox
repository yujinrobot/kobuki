/**

@page enInstallationAppleGuide Installation - Apple

This is currently untested and unsupported. The work required to run it on apple should not be significant though - the 
libraries are largely compatible (with the possible exception of some porting needed for the time functions).

If you would like to do this, please contact the maintainers of the project, we are happy to help.
